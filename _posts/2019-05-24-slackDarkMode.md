Oh how I love everything to be black and dark.  Like my [Slack](https://github.com/LanikSJ/slack-dark-mode).  (Haha, pun intended.)

If you're a Slack 4.0 though, edit:
`~/Library/Containers/com.tinyspeck.slackmacgap/Data/Library/Application\ Support/Slack/local-settings.json`

And change `"bootSonic":"once"` to `"bootSonic":"never"`.
